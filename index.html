          <p>We believe a child’s development is enhanced with exposure to a variety of sports at a young age.
            In line with our philosophy of sharing our passion for river running with our guests, we have
            developed
            4-day kids’
            kayaking camps that will help build paddling skills, confidence, and an appreciation for the
            beautiful area
            we live in.</p>
          <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
          <p class="margin-top-10">All of our professional instructors love what they do, have a passion for
            running
            rivers, and love
            getting younger paddlers hooked on their favorite sport. We work with kids during our youth

          <p>Parasailing is one of the activities that is filled with fun and adventure. If you are witnessing
            individuals parasailing
            off the shore, you too might be dreaming about taking part in such an exciting activity.
            However, without
            knowing what to
            expect, this once-in-a-lifetime experience may bring fear instead of excitement. Fear and
            uncertainty are
            all normal feelings
            when you are not fully aware of the things to expect as you soar through the air.</p>
          <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
          <p class="margin-top-10">Expect peak seasons to be fully booked most of the time. There will be a
            lot of
            parasailers who are
            also waiting to get their turn. On average, each parasailer spends one and a half hours in this
            activity.
            You know you are in
            good hands if the company you have booked the activity with takes their time to explain what is
            going to
            happen during the activity.</p>
